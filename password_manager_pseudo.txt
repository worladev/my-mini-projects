'''
PASSWORD MANAGER PSEUDOCODE

Write a class called Password_manager.

The class should have a list called old_passwords 
that holds all of the user's past passwords.

The last item of the list is the user's current 
password.

There should be
A method called get_password that returns the current password 
A method called set_password that sets the user's password.

The set_password method should only change the 
password if the attempted password
is different from all the user's past passwords.

Finally, create a method called is_correct that
receives a string and returns a boolean True or 
False depending on whether the string is equal
to the current password or not.
